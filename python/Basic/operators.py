# - Logical Operators - Logic operators
# - Arithmetic Operators - Numerical Calculations
# - Bitwise operators

# Arithmetic operator
print("Floor : ", 5 // 3)
print("Exponentiation : ", 5 ** 3)
print("Modulus operator : %", 5 % 5)

# Assignment operators ( Addition of value in { variables normally it is = } )
x_variable = 5
x_variable += 5
x_variable -= 2
x_variable **= 2
print(x_variable)

# Comparison Operators { True and false == }
comparison_variable = 10
print(comparison_variable != 3)

# Logical operators and or
a = True
b = False
# print(a and a)
# print(a and b)
# print(b and b)

# identity operators
print(a is not b)

# Membership in and not in

List_membership = [32, 324, 23, 23, 63, 42, 43, 23]
# print(32 not in list)


# bitwise operators
# 0 = 00
# 1 = 01
# 2 = 10
# 3 = 11

print(0 | 1)
print(0 or 1)
